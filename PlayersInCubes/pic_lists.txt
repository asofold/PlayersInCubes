PlayersInCubes - Lists
-----------------------------------------

"Simple" attempt to have players see each other or not based on their distance.

- Equality approach: Sectors know which players can see it and which are inside. 
    If one player cant see a sector anymore, the players in the sector cant see that player anymore neither.
- Location Heuristic: To prevent too much checking, players are checked when they move far enough (or time enough has passed).


STRUCTURES
------------------
- World split in chunks of equal size.
- HashMap with one hash (3 dim).
- Sectors keep Sets for players that are inside and players that can see the sector.
- A position is kept for every player, that will be reset upon moving far enough (or probably timeout).
- A player gets registered in cubes that are within a certain distance.

use identities ?



POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------------
- Lots, supposedly
- Cube lookup: Prevent object creation, lookup by hash directly (refactor to arrays + modulo?)
- Storing cubes: use array + modulo to get past all the keys, entry sets iterations over objects. (CubeServer) 
- Store some objects longer / permanently, to avoid creating them newly.
