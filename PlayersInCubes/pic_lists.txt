STRUCTURES
------------------
- World split in cubes of equal size.
- HashMap with one hash (3 dim).
- Sectors keep Sets for players that are inside and players that can see the sector.
- Efficiency: A position is kept for every player, that will be reset upon moving far enough (or probably timeout).
- A player gets registered in cubes that are within a certain distance.

use identities ?



POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------------
- More optimization is possible with remembering the cube a player is in, though that might contradict distCube
- renderBlind: render Blind with all players at once.
- Cube lookup: Prevent object creation, lookup by hash directly (refactor to arrays + modulo?)
- Storing cubes: use array + modulo to get past all the keys, entry sets iterations over objects. (CubeServer) 
- Store some objects longer / permanently, to avoid creating them newly.

POSSIBLE FEATURES
------------------------------
- Permanently loaded cubes with special properties + API (turn lights in town on ...).


STACK
-----------------------------------

Stats for some timings ? 

***

? add a way for compatibility with vanishing plugins.
? add a way to see all others always. [+ add invisibility ?]

*** RELEASE


*** Refactor : the canSee logic: canView != isInside ! (currently: players that can see a cube see each other.)
