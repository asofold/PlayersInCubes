PlayersInCubes - Lists
-----------------------------------------

"Simple" attempt to have players see each other or not based on their distance.

LICENSE
------------------
"Minimal" for a Bukkit plugin.


STRUCTURES
------------------
- World split in chunks of equal size.
- HashMap with one hash (3 dim).
- Sectors keep Sets for players that are inside and players that can see the sector.
- A position is kept for every player, that will be reset upon moving far enough (or probably timeout).
- A player gets registered in cubes that are within a certain distance.

use identities ?



POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------------
- More optimization is possible with remembering the cube a player is in, though that might contradict distCube
- renderBlind: render Blind with all players at once.
- Cube lookup: Prevent object creation, lookup by hash directly (refactor to arrays + modulo?)
- Storing cubes: use array + modulo to get past all the keys, entry sets iterations over objects. (CubeServer) 
- Store some objects longer / permanently, to avoid creating them newly.

POSSIBLE FEATURES
------------------------------
- Permanently loaded cubes with special properties + API (turn lights in town on ...).


STACK
-----------------------------------

add a way to see all others always.

Stats for timings 
Stats for number of cubes.

Configuration + default settings + reloading 

make work with smaller than cubeSIze distCube
