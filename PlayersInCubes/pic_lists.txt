PlayersInCubes - Lists
-----------------------------------------


LICENSE
------------------
"Minimal" for a Bukkit plugin.
(Probably to be updated!)


DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------

PlayersInCubes is a "simple" attempt to have players see each other or not, 
 based on their distance.
The distance of players to each other is estimated by associating players with
 all cube-partitions within a certain range of the player, and let players 
 see each other whenever both are associated with one or more identical cubes.
Even though there is a good bit of inaccuracy and variation for the distance, 
 players always both see each other or both can not see each other.
 
 IMPORTANT: 
 * This will most likely be incompatible with any sort of 
    vanish or disguise plugins.
 * All players are treated alike, exceptions are planned.

COMMANDS AND PERMISSIONS
-------------------------

Manage with /playersincubes ... (aliases: pic, pcubes)

* Reload the configuration:
    ... reload
    playersincubes.reload
* Show info about the configuration:
    ... info
    playersincubes.info
* Re check all players:
    ... cleanup
    playersincubes.cleanup
* Disable checking (will write back to config.yml):
    ... disable
    playersincubes.disable
* Enable (will write back to config.yml):
    ... enable
    playersincubes.enable
* View stats about cubes in use:
    ... stats
    playersincubes.stats.view
* Reset stats:
    ... stats reset
    playersincubes.stats.reset


Configuration
----------------------------------------
* enabled
    If checks are enabled at all. 
    Can be altered by commands (see commands section).
* ignore-worlds
    This is a list of worlds not to be included in checks,
     the world names must be accurate in letter case.
* cube.size
    The size of a cube.
* cube.distance
    A cube center must be within this distance from a player,
    to get associated.
* lazy.distance
    A player must move at least this far to force re-checking,
     this improves the performance clearly, at the cost of accuracy.
* lazy.lifetime
    Duration in seconds after wich a re-check of a player is forced,
     if the player moves, in any case. Set to 0 to not use this.
    This is probably unnecessary to set, ever.
    
The configuration can be reloaded at runtime (see commands section).

Implications: 
* The maximal distance at which players might see each other,
    seems to be the sum of cube.size and cube.distance, the minimal distance
     at which players can not see each others will be the maximum of both.
    Still dist.lazy has to be counted in.

STRUCTURES
------------------
- World split in cubes of equal size.
- HashMap with one hash (3 dim).
- Cubes are associated with the player according to the distance of 
    their center to the player.
- Cubes keep Sets for players that can see the sector. 
    Any overlap for two players means they can see each other.
- Optimization (lazy): A position is kept for every player, 
    that will be reset upon moving far enough (or after timeout).
    If no reset of the position is necessary, 
    no changes will be done to associated cubes.


POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------------
- More optimization is possible with remembering the cube a player is in, 
    though that might contradict distCube
- Cube lookup: Prevent object creation and some iterators and set creation, 
    lookup by hash directly (refactor to arrays + modulo?)
- Store some objects longer / permanently, to avoid creating them newly.
- Use sets of players in a world to make faster estimation whom to render visible on simple rechecks.

POSSIBLE FEATURES
------------------------------
- Permanently loaded cubes with special properties 
    + API (turn on lights in town or the like ...).
- World specific settings (replacing ignore worlds, but also for other settings)

STACK
-----------------------------------
? refactor a bit for CubeServer.players 
? Stats for some timings (bukkit has such though)
? add a way for compatibility with vanishing plugins.
? add invisibility ? (but do respect who can be seen)
? add a way to see all others always.
